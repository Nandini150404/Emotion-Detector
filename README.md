ðŸ˜„ Photo to Emoji - Emotion Detection Project

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect emotions from live webcam input and maps the detected emotion to an appropriate emoji. It's built using Python, OpenCV, deep learning models, and possibly `fer` (Facial Emotion Recognition) or a custom-trained model.
